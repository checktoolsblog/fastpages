# 1. Disinformation

## AI and Disinformation

Most people have too many friends on Facebook or follow to many people on Twitter to see all of their updates, and most views on YouTube come [from the own site recommendations](https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-ces-2018-neal-mohan/). In these cases what we spend the time on is determined by AI. This systems will provide posts, tweets and videos that maximize the time you stay in each platform. This selection of information to maximize engagement has some big unexpected side effects.
To maximize our watching time, YouTube will feed us with more videos related to our searches and to the ones we spend more time, Facebook will do the same with posts we are likely to "Like!" or share with our friends propagating the engagement to other users.

Also, these AIs will reward creators who achieve more engagement, influencing creators to publish content that will further encourage users to increase the use of the channel. Non mainstream interest can be found online easily and creators of these subjects will be found and rewarded, this includes sourdough baking and fake news. The system doesn't differentiate an innocent topic as sourdough baking from fake news.

These goals have nothing to do with the veracity of the information, in fact if what improves our engagement are news about facts far from reality, we will be recommended more news on the same line and from here it is easy to see the recommendation system spiraling. One special topic that easily gets into this dynamic is the case of fake news.
